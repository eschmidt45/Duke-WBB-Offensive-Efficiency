# Duke-WBB-Offensive-Efficiency

This study was conducted as part of my research for my Master's thesis at Duke. All work was completed independently. A brief summary is provided below:

The purpose of this study is to assess the field goal efficiency of the Duke Womenâ€™s Basketball offense with data collected on possession by possession breakdowns. More specifically, the aim is to understand what features make the most efficient possessions, and how a coaching staff can utilize this feedback to optimize the offense.
